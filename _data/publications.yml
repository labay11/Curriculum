  abstract: '*Provisional*. Distribution of high-quality entanglement over long distances in a key step for the development of a future Quantum Internet. Exponential photon loss in optical fibres with distance makes it impractical to connect two nodes directly. Furthermore, the impossibility of copying in the quantum regime forbids using the same solutions as in classical communication. Quantum Repeaters can be used to extend entanglement to longer distances using teleportation, although straightforward application still leads to an exponential decrease in the quality of the link. Entanglement purification probabilistically allows for obtaining few high-quality links from many low-quality ones. Several protocols have been proposed that combine quantum repeaters with purification steps, however required hardware is still lacking. Moreover, it is unclear how an improvement over a certain hardware parameter affects the final link quality or entanglement generation rate. Analytical expressions are hard to find and usually assumptions are needed, limiting their applicability. In this work, a realistic repeater chain is modelled using NetSquid, a quantum network simulator, and genetic algorithms are used to optimise the minimal improvement needed over state-of-the-art hardware and protocol parameters to achieve a desired link quality and rate. This is a step in the direction of a blueprint for a pan-European Quantum Internet.'

  abstract: 'The Copenhaguen interpretation provides a mathematical framework that has proved useful toevaluate the probabilities for future events in terms of our previous knowledge on a system. However,it is a source of controversy since any physical intuition we want to give  on  the  processes yields paradoxes like instantaneous collapse, spooky action at a distance... The goal of the relational interpretation is to solve some of them without changing the actual formalism, purely by focusing our attention to what is really the intrinsic property of Quantum Mechanics: discreteness.'

  abstract: 'The identification of abrupt changes in the behaviour of a system is of crucial importance in areas such as medicine, climatology, biology... Here we will discuss the problem in the quantum
world, we will consider a source generating a certain state which suffers an alteration and suddenly changes to another. The question is to find the position of the change based on measures carried
out on the states with the greatest possible probability of success. Recently, the solution to the problem was found when the two states, before and after the change, were pure. In this thesis,
we will study the case in which the states are mixed and therefore the uncertainty in the system increases. We will use both analytical and numerical techniques to find the optimal measure that
maximises the probability of correctly identifying the point of change.'

  abstract: 'The objective of this research project is to create a device capable of analysing air pollution using an Arduino and some sensors to measure
  temperature, humidity, liquefied petroleum gas, ethanol, hydrocarbon gases, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The measurements are sent via a
  Bluetooth module to an Android mobile, where they are stored and presented. It is included in the Android application capabilities like speech recognition,
  speech synthesis and geolocation.
  Tailpipe emissions have been compared between diesel/gasoline and new/old cars.'
