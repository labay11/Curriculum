## CV and thoughts

This website is thought to be a summary of my academic life and some of my interest and writtings that I'd like to share with the rest. Take a look at https://labay11.github.io/.

### Development

Requirements: `jekyll`, `bundle`.

Run with `bundle exec jekyll s`, the website should be available at http://localhost:4000/.

[`bulma`](https://bulma.io/) version `0.9.0` is used for the UI.
